## 4.4.2_Graph.ipynb  (Adjacency Matrix)
- Summary: analysis of complexity and overview of adjacency lists, adjacency matrix, and edge list. Cool graph through Konnect (when site works).
- Filetype: .ipynb

## CS5012_Keeley_HW2_12SEP2020.ipynb (Binary Search Algorithm)
- Summary: iterative and recursive implementations of Binary Search using "partitioning" in Python. Master Theorem and recurrence relation are discussed in terms of complexity.
- Filetype: .ipynb

## HW5_13OCT2020.ipynb (HeapSort Algorithm)
- Summary: HeapSort algorithm in Python and discussion of complexity.
- Filetype: .ipynb

## HW6_regex_17OCT2020.ipynb (Regular Expressions - REGEX)
- Summary: programmed several useful algorithms using regular expression operations in Python to parse input text.
- Filetype: .ipynb

## CS5012_HW8.6 (ER Diagrams)
- Summary: ER diagrams for hypothetical IMDB and hospital databases via Draw.IO. Includes cardinality and relationships.
- Filetype: draw.io

## Mod11hw_Keeley.ipynb (Threading and Queues for Database Transactions)
- Summary: investigated threading and transaction conflicts in Python.
- Filetype: .ipynb


## Mod1_Binary_Linear_Search_Code Sample_7SEP2020.ipynb (Binary Search Algorithm and Linear Search Algorithm)
- Summary: investigated difference between linear and binary searches, particularly in terms of complexity. Implemented both in Python.
- Filetype: .ipynb

## Module 3 HW_Two-sum_29SEP2020.ipynb (Hash Tables?)
- Summary: first attempt at interacting with Hash Tables in Python? 
- Filetype: .ipynb

## Module 3 HW_Three-sum_29SEP2020.ipynb (Hash Tables II?)
- Summary: another attempt at interacting with Hash Tables in Python?
- Filetype: .ipynb

## Module 3_Randomized Selection_26SEP2020.ipynb (Randomized Selection Algorithm and Hash Tables)
- Summary: full meaning of this assignment was lost on the textbook. Basically, coded an algorithm in Python that randomly partitioned within a list to return a target value.
- Filetype: .ipynb

## charmer.drawio (ER Diagrams)
- Summary: ER diagram that captured the relationships between buyers and sellers. 
- Filetype: draw.io

## closestPair_Nick.ipynb (Closest Pair Problem)
- Summary: group project that required coding a recursive binary search algorithm that determined the closest pair of points within a randomly generated list of points. Edge case involved points grouped around the middle threshold of the graph "mid point."
